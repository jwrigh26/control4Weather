# control 4 Weather

A iOS Native app that demos using Operation Queues and some other cool Swift functional code using the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api) within an iOS application.

## Getting Started

### Installing

This repo uses no third-party libraries. So to get started, just copy the repo and open in Xcode 8.

## Running the tests

I really wanted to write some tests because some of the API calls are not 100% dependable. Particuarly the bulk weather condition call.
I haven't had time yet to write these tests, but it is on my todo list.

## Built With

* [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/api) - The weather API I used
* [Apiary](https://apiary.io/) - The web API I used to hold static city JSON

That's it! The challenge was to use only mysefl to write this project. I have to say I really really wanted to at least use some kind of JSON parser library. For parsing JSON in Swift is a very painful time consuming process.
